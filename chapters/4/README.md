Common Lisp supports arrays of at least 7 dimensions. ONe-dimensional arrays are called vectors.
Strings are vectors of characters.  Characters are objects in their own right.
Sequences include lists and vectors.  Many sequence functions take keyword arguments from a standard set.
Parsing is easy in Lisp because it has so many functions that work on strings.
Calling defstruct defines a structure with named fields.  It is a good example of a program that writes programs.
Binary search trees are useful for maintaining a sorted collection of objects.
Hash tables provide a more efficient way to represent sets and mappings.
